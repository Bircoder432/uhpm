# UHPM - Universal Home Package Manager 🚀

**UHPM** is a universal package manager for home use, written in Rust. Future plans include support for application distribution similar to brew.

## Features ✨

- **High performance** (Rust implementation) ⚡
- **Universal** - install packages from files and repositories 📦
- **Version management** - switch between package versions 🔄
- **Developer tools** - create and build packages 🛠️
- **Autocompletion** - generate shell completion scripts 🐚



## Quick Start 🚀

### Install package from repository
`uhpm install package-name`

### Install package from file
`uhpm install -f ./package.uhp`
or
`uhpm install --file ./package.uhp`

### Package Management 📊
List installed packages:
`uhpm list`

Update package from repository:
`uhpm update package-name`

Update package from file:
`uhpm update -f package-name`

Remove package:
`uhpm remove package-name`

Search packages:
`uhpm search query`

### Package Creation (for developers) 👨‍💻

**⚠️ Important Notice:** This project is in early development stages. The package creation procedure and specifications are subject to significant changes in future versions. Please check for updates regularly.

#### Initialize a new package
```shell
uhpmk init
```
This command initializes the basic package structure:
```
package/
├── symlist
└── uhp.toml
```

Optionally, you can also create a `uhpbuild` file (this will be automatically generated by `uhpmk init` in future versions). The `uhpbuild` file should be a simple shell script that handles the build process for your package.

#### Configure package metadata
In the `uhp.toml` file, fill in your package's metadata:
```toml
name = "my_package"
author = "YourName"
version = "0.1.0"
checksum = "TODO"
dependencies = []

[src]
type = "Raw"
value = "TODO"
```

#### Define package symlinks
In the `symlist` file, specify the symbolic links that will be created from your package to the system:

**Example symlist:**
```
# Symlink list for package
# Format: <source_path> <target_path_with_variables>
#
# Available variables:
#   $HOME - user home directory
#   $XDG_DATA_HOME - user data directory (~/.local/share)
#   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME - user config directory (~/.config)
#   $XDG_BIN_HOME - user bin directory (~/.local/bin)

bin/my_binary $HOME/.local/bin/my_binary
share/applications/my_app.desktop $XDG_DATA_HOME/applications/my_app.desktop
```

**Note:** The `checksum` and `src.value` fields in `uhp.toml` are placeholders that will need to be properly configured based on your package's source and verification requirements.



## Project Structure 🏗️

The project consists of two main components:
- **uhpm** - main client for package management
- **uhpmk** - utility for package development and building

## Available Commands ⌨️

### Main commands (uhpm)
- `install` - Install package from repository
- `install -f/--file` - Install package from file
- `remove` - Remove installed packages 🗑️
- `list` - List installed packages 📋
- `self-remove` - Remove UHPM from system
- `update` - Update package from repository
- `update -f/--file` - Update package from file
- `switch` - Switch active package version
- `completions` - Search packages and generate autocompletion scripts

### Development commands (uhpmk)
- `init` - Initialize new package template
- `build` - Build package using build script
- `pack` - Package directory into .uhp archive

## Development 🔧

### Build from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bircoder432/uhpm.git
cd uhpm
cargo build --release
```

### Development installation
